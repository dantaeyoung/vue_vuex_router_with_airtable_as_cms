## Getting started with development

In order to authenticate to Airtable API, you have to create a `.env` file in the root directory. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the parameters (get this from @melaniehoff or @dantaeyoung)

Then:
- `npm install` to install dependencies
- `npm run serve` to create a hot-reloading server for development on `localhost:8080`

If you change the details above, you need to restart your server.
